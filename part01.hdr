This is a much modified version of the public domain spread sheet sc,
posted several years ago by Mark Weiser as vc, originally by James
Gosling.

Starting 4/4/90: (I will be maintaining Sc for a while at least, Robert
Bond has been very busy lately) Sc is not a product of Grauel Enterprises,
Inc.  It is supplied as is with no warranty, express or implied, as a
service to Usenet readers.  It is not copyrighted, either.  Have at it.
